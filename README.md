I've made this device to connect my [NTC thermistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor#NTC) to a [Livolo thermostat](https://www.livolo.eu/c-4632899/livolo-thermostat/) which only works with a [DS18B20 digital thermometer](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/DS18B20.html).

## Instructions

### `table.h`

You need to generate the `table.h` for your particular NTC thermistor. It contains an array which maps a measured ADC value to actual temperature. You can do this via the provided `table.py` script.

Measure your NTC resistance at two different temperature points. Then call `table.py` specifying your measurements:

```sh
python table.py \
    --t1 <temperature-1> --r1 <resistance-at-t1> \
    --t2 <temperature-2> --r2 <resistance-at-t2> \
    --rf <fixed-resistor>
```

I recommend to measure your fixed resistor actual resistance to improve accuracy.

If your program memory is too small, you can specify `--min-t` and/or `--max-t` parameters. Then the table will be generated in a specified temperature range generating less array entries thus taking less memory.

See [Measuring the temperature with NTCs](http://www.giangrandi.ch/electronics/ntc/ntc.shtml) for more information on how the conversion is implemented.

### Connections

- NTC goes to GND and the ADC pin.
- Connect Vcc and the ADC pin using a fixed resistor.
- Put a capacitor in parallel with the NTC. This will reduce random measurement glitches. 100nF worked for me. If you won't, you'll probably sometimes get inadequate measurements due to noise on the wires.

### Note for Livolo thermostats

Damn them! ðŸ˜¡

1. Supposingly, one has to solder out the second sensor deep inside the thermostat **even before turning it on for the first time**. If you've already done that, you may try to figure out the calibrated temperature shift that the thermostat has calculated and remembered. Wait ~4 minutes and note the difference between displayed and real temperatures. Then, change `livoloShift` in the source code to compensate this.
2. Livolo's 1-Wire master has non-standard timings and does not read all the data transmitted. You'll need to patch OneWireHub's `OneWireHub_config.h` and `DS18B20.cpp` using the included `livolo.patch`. See also https://github.com/orgua/OneWireHub/issues/84.
